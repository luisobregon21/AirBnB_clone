# AirBnB clone - The console

The console is the first step of building
a full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This project starts us off on the backend side
of building a web application and points in the
right direction of building a fully tested and functioning
console in Python.


## The command interpreter aka the console

The console can be launched by executing the console.py file.

As such:
```
$ ./console.py
Welcome to HBNB. Type help or ? to list commands.

(hbnb) 
```
To use the console, you can simply type the help command
and it will provide a list of commands to use. You can also type
help "command" to get a brief description of what the command does.

As such:
```
$ ./console.py
Welcome to HBNB. Type help or ? to list commands.

(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) help create
Creates an instance of the specified class

(hbnb) 
```
